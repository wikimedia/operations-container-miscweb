Hi,

I created a MediaWiki extension which uses LilyPond (in safe mode) to produce
musical notation. For short pieces, i.e. to describe a musical concept, you can
use

&lt;lilypond&gt;c4 e g&lt;/lilypond&gt;

If you want to hear it by clicking on the resulting picture, just use
&lt;lilymidi&gt; instead of &lt;lilypond&gt;.

And the best: you can also use it to write whole pieces in a team, by using
&lt;lilybook&gt; instead of &lt;lilypond&gt;. The contents are then interpreted as a
LilyPond file, and the pages are output as pictures.

I did my own MediaWiki extension rather than use wikitex, because LilyPond is
steering clear of TeX (text and music do have different dimensions).

Ciao,
Dscho</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Hi,

well, after not hearing _anything_ about the chances to integrate it into
wikipedia, I sorta lost interest in updating the extension.

Having said that, if there is actually a _chance_ that _anybody_ is interested,
I will be happy to address any raised issues. However, you have to convince me
that I will not again invest much time and effort for _nothing at all_.

As I said, last time I tried it, it was working beautifully. I have no reason
to expect that this changed since my last test.

Ciao,
Dscho

I agree with your comment. I'm trying to write courses on music in wikiversidad (the spanish branch of wikiversity) but i couldn't because we're not able to write scores. I have seen too many comments requesting the same thing, but (as it happenned to me) never got answers to those comments. I'm just a musician and i want to write music in a wikiversidad article...but it discouraged me that it's too hard to find answers and to find someone that can include lilypond in mediawiki software. Excuse me, please, for my english.
P.D.: the only place that led me here (thanks god, though i'm agnostic) was the IRC channel.</pre>

Please read the previous comments before you post.  As I stated in <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=189#c19">comment #19</a>, someone needs to bring this to the attention of one of the core devs, namely Tim or Brion, so either 1) it can be reviewed for security and other issues and then either enabled, or 2) the problems can be specified and addressed by the author(s), then the extension enabled.  If nobody takes it upon themselves to pursue the issue, nothing will get done.</pre>

&gt; someone needs to bring this to the attention of one of the core devs, namely
&gt; Tim or Brion, so either 1) it can be reviewed for security and other issues and
&gt; then either enabled, or 2) the problems can be specified and addressed by the

Thank you for your fast answer. I'd read the previous comments, but I guessed that in 7 months since your previous comment someone did asked on IRC (but I can't confirm that, because the discussions on IRC are not logged).

I'll try to leave the request there to Tim or Brion. What is the server/channel?

Thanks in advance, and excuse me for my limited english.

After 4 years (and being just to install an existing plugin) it seems that the developers are not interested at all...

There are other projects where you can submit musical sheets. Two of them are Mutopia: <a href="http://www.mutopiaproject.org/">http://www.mutopiaproject.org/</a> and Musipedia: <a href="http://www.musipedia.org/">http://www.musipedia.org/</a>

I can only say that Lilypond extension disable the macros for security reasons. But of course, that doesn't assure that the plugin is safe enough...

Because Wikimedia has too few employees and is too disorganized right now to mandate that anyone is *required* to keep up with feature requests or submitted patches or much of anything else that's not critical to stop the site from falling to pieces.  So you have to rely on the good old-fashioned &quot;squeaky wheel gets the grease&quot; method.  Efficient it's not, but it's the state of things right now.  When there are more senior developers, one might be assigned to review of patches and extension enable-ments, but there are only two now, and they have too much to do already without attempting to review every patch and extension that anyone submits.</pre>

The problems with LilyPond are sufficiently severe that I have, from time to time, researched alternative music renderers such as Philip's Music Writer that don't have an embedded scripting language. But if you really want to write a LilyPond extension, you could at least go to the trouble of reviewing its security, and dealing with the obvious problems in your code.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >It's abcm2ps, and you don't need to be so sarcastic.

Using LilyPond directly seems to be out of question for security reasons. The question is, is using abc2ly or abc2ps also out of question? That is, do you believe that somehow, through specially-crafted ABC notes, someone would be able to create a malicious LilyPond or PS file? If this is not a problem, then Extension:AbcMusic could be used, or a modified version of it that would use abcm2ps instead of abc2ly. If it is, a new tool, say, abc2svg could be made that would render ABC without the intermediate scripting language.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >So, if I'm understanding this, the options are either extend texvc to sanitize lilypond, which seems close to tex,  using abc2ly to generate safe lilypond, or using some other converter to render abc without lilypond.  Is there a reason to prefer one over the other, or is it just a matter of getting a working extension into SVN that doesn't pass lilypond code directly?

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Yes, that's basically it. Full option tree is something like this:

1. Use LilyPond with a sanitizer.
2. Use ABC with...
2.1. abc2ly.
2.2. abc2ps.
2.3. custom renderer.

The first question is that of usability: ABC is simpler to write than LilyPond, but LilyPond has more features. Should we use one or the other (or both)? Community input is needed here, for example I'd like to know did people have needs that could not be fulfilled by ABC? (Allgemeines Deutsches Kommersbuch mentioned here, I think could be done with ABC.)

If the community feels that it needs LilyPond, then a sanitizer has to be written. I have no idea who would do it or how much would it take.

If ABC is acceptable, it could theoretically be enabled tomorrow. Choice exists between using abc2ly (converts ABC to LilyPond, then converts LilyPond to PNG) and abc2ps (converts ABC to PostScript, then converts PostScript to PNG). The choice is mostly technical, and I intend to run some benchmarks in order to see what would be the faster solution. Using a custom renderer that would make SVG or PNG files directly from ABC would be needed only if the previous two are deemed unsafe, which doesn't seem to be the case.

Another smaller issue is: if ABC is used, should it be extended so that it is more user-friendly? Community input is needed on this.</pre>

This is a non-choice.  The community desperately wants to be able to transcribe music and LillyPond has no realistic chance of being enabled in the forseeable future. This bug was created in 2004 and no work is ongoing to make LilyPond safe to use.  If there is any method that can be enabled within the month the community support for using that method will be there.  If you need this proven, please explain what you will want for proof of support and I will work on it.

User-friendly is good :)  But I think once an extention is enabled and people have a chance to actually work with it, then we can get better input on what sort of improvements are going to be most wanted.  No one has had much of a chance to learn music notation yet, and I am not sure sure what we will find lacking when trancribing real texts.

Sure there are choices.  Although one extension was vetoed, the underlying application can still be used.  The most visible choice to the community would be how much functionality would be lost by using ABC syntax instead of LillyPond.  

The others seem less drastic, since it shouldn't be too difficult to change the rendering pipeline if needed.

I guess my point is that I don't see any real choice over lost functionality when we have had zero functionality for a very long time.  

The more technical stuff is a little lost on me, but I don't think the community would want to hold out for LilyPond if they can have music notes without it.

More precisely, how much functionality would be lost by using ABC syntax instead of *crippled* LilyPond, with a carefully-selected whitelist of commands?  LilyPond is much more powerful than ABC, but a lot of that is surely because it allows arbitrary scripts.

I agree with Jennifer that it would be better to get whatever is fastest into place, then worry about details.  If ABC is fastest to do and the eventual consensus is that it's not good enough, LilyPond can always be implemented at our leisure.  They can both be enabled in parallel, ABC notation can be manually and/or automatically converted over time, and ABC can maybe be disabled eventually.  In any event, ABC is likely to be good enough for the large majority of uses; in the few remaining cases a manually-created PNG or SVG can be used if people like, pending a more sophisticated solution.

Note that I say this on general principle, knowing nothing about ABC, LilyPond, or indeed music or musical notation in general.  :)  But I think that on a technical basis, we should go with whatever's fastest to do in this case, even if it misses some functionality.</pre>

Yes, and we should also consider that some pieces may already be typeset in standard format.  So if the extension implements the full ABC format, we may be able to host some of this content.  A crippled LilyPond, even if it has more functionality, would be more hit or miss. 

<span class="quote">&gt; I agree with Jennifer that it would be better to get whatever is fastest into

Or we could consider supporting multiple music formats the equivalent of hosting multiple image formats.  Although it is more complicated since people would edit the code on wiki, if typeset music is available it would be easier to add if it didn't need to be converted first.

Yeah, I'm with you there.  I'm not even 100% sure that texvc could easily parse LilyPond, but I wasn't aware of ABC when I looked at that.

LilyPond is expressive enough that it's possible to write malicious code that could take a long time to, or possibly never, complete.  The workaround for this would be similar to what is done for math; to tokenize the input, and make sure the commands are in a known whitelist of safe commands.  That way, any music with a macro would be flagged as an error, since the might not be safe.

So it would probably take longer to add LilyPond support than ABC (which shouldn't preclude adding LilyPond later) since someone would need to develop this preprocessor.  Then, since we'd only support a subset of LilyPond, many valid files would not be supported, at least without modification; and we don't know what portion that would be.

A really rudimentary research into LilyPond's documentation would show that the safe
mode relies on GUILEs safe mode, which has been around so long that you can be
certain that it is fleshed out.

So, a preprocessor is not needed at all.

The argument that many freely available LilyPond files do not work in safe mode is
doubly bogus:

1) they can be fixed with relatively small effort, as most pieces should not require
any special (and possibly unsafe) operations at all,

2) the extension is not about copying existing stuff into the wiki.  It is about
creating content collaboratively, so the unsafe features would simply not be used.

I have to admit, though, that I am amazed how long this discussion would drag out.

If I had known about the timely decision-making powers of the responsible persons,
I do not know if I would have spent the time writing the extension in the first
place.

It is really a sorry story.</pre>

<span class="quote">&gt; A really rudimentary research into LilyPond's documentation would show that the
&gt; safe
&gt; mode relies on GUILEs safe mode, which has been around so long that you can be
&gt; certain that it is fleshed out.</span >

You're missing the fact that LilyPond's safe mode *does not claim* to prevent infinite loops.  It *only* prevents operations like file access.  If you would read the documentation that you condescendingly told us all to read, you would find:

&quot;--safe does *not* detect resource overuse. It is still possible to make the program hang indefinitely, for example by feeding cyclic data structures into the backend. Therefore, if using LilyPond on a publicly accessible webserver, the process should be limited in both CPU and memory usage.&quot;
<a href="http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.9/Documentation/user/lilypond/Invoking-lilypond">http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.9/Documentation/user/lilypond/Invoking-lilypond</a>

Therefore it *must* be run through some kind of sanitizer to avoid &quot;cyclic data structures&quot; or whatever.  Killing the process if it eats too much CPU and RAM and having the render fail would also be a possible solution, but not a very nice one.

<span class="quote">&gt; The argument that many freely available LilyPond files do not work in safe mode
&gt; is doubly bogus:</span >

The software's documentation appears to disagree:

&quot;Note that --safe will prevent many useful LilyPond snippets from being compiled.&quot;

River has written [[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&go=Go&search=mw%3AExtension%3AABC">mw:Extension:ABC</a>]].  Given the author, if she's willing to say it's safe, it could probably be enabled without an extensive separate security review.  It seems like the most useful way forward at this point, even if it's not as powerful as LilyPond.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Yes, infinite loops would allow attacks, that is correct.  I could think of a number
of strategies how to teach LilyPond to avoid that, and I am sure that at least one
of those strategies would have been implemented already a long time ago, if the
issue had been raised on the lilypond-devel list.  (Just as the --jail option has
been implemented already.)

The documentation can say as much as it wants about useful snippets, the reality is
that you can do almost everything you want without using Scheme, however.  And
certainly the rest of the things only matters when you want to produce a printed
copy of the music which adheres to a certain standard.

In other words, nothing I would expect a MediaWiki extension to support.

In yet other words, it would be a safe bet that a --safe=no-scheme mode in LilyPond
would do all ABC is capable of, and more.

However, your last remark really boils it down to the point: ever since I submitted
the initial version of the LilyPond extension, everybody seemed to tell me in all
but writing that I should just go away, because ABC would be chosen eventually.

That's perfectly okay.  I have other interesting stuff to do.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >I've got two points out of this long time discussion (5 years now). Long time only because there long times of inactivity in between. And it seems not only to be a discussion for technical reason but also a lot of politics.

There seems to be two systems ABC and lilipond, both are more or less capable of doing the job. ABC less and lilipond more from my personal point of view. 

There is an '''old''' implementation which has been proven to work with lilipond and wikis and this solution is already in use on other mediawiki installations but not in wikimedia universum. 
And '''newer''' one based on ABC which translates to lilypond and using lilypond afterwards to to the job. It may be possible to work with ABC in an alternative mode via postscript but both modes must be tested first for stability, resources and performance.

From this point of view it seems to be a clear joice to use lilipond directly without any stumbling intermediates.

The big argument against lilipond - as far as I understand from the discussion - is the possibility for an attack by introducing malicous code (infinite loops). But as far as I can see there are possibility provided by lilipond itself  to prevent exactly this. Using save mode, no-scheme  and other. The parts of lilypond which will use these ''hazardous'' parts have no benefit for our purposes and lilypond can be used with this options disabled. 

Now my question is: Why should we use ABC when we can have the needed things directly in a save manner.

I would beg to have exact look on this save mode of lilipond and if the risk is low enough activate it on the wikis. 
If there is a need for further testing within the community, I think the german language wikisource would be able to do some tests in the real live,

We have several pieces of text where we need a music extension.

Nobody that I've seen has presented evidence that there are options in current versions of LilyPond that will prevent the possibility of unreasonable or even unbounded CPU/memory usage.  The LilyPond documentation says safe mode does not do this.  If there are other options like &quot;no-scheme&quot; (which I'm fairly sure has not been mentioned before and which I can't find in the LilyPond documentation), these need to be pointed out so that they can be considered.

River (who is a long-time developer and root sysadmin) has said that the ABC extension should be no less safe than ImageMagick.  If someone pursues that, it could therefore probably get enabled within a week on technical grounds.  There is currently, to my knowledge, no LilyPond extension available that even claims to prevent trivial DoS attacks, and it will not be a credible contender until someone writes one.  If you think you can write such an extension, but don't want to waste the effort when it might not get enabled, try asking Tim whether he'll agree in advance to review it.

I agree that our review process is dysfunctional, but it's dysfunctional because of lack of trusted people willing to review things, and complaining about it is not going to fix that.  You can either give up or make the best of it, your decision.</pre>

I'm not capable of doing the job you wants to urge me todo. :) I' working as a software engineer but I don't have any experiences in that type of software. But when the central Software team is shure that this - sorry from my point of view nearly unknown ABC - is the right choice and can be activated immediately why don't you do that.  The community is asking for a usable method of typesetting music notes. And even if the the second best choice is the solution, than we should take that.

Second best choice simply because even ABC is using the liliypond system, which seems to be a de facto standard and this ABC system is just the sanitizer your are talking about.

*Any* interested party could have asked what Wikimedia's requirements were and asked themselves on the LilyPond list whether they could be implemented.  You cannot blame Wikimedia sysadmins for failing to crusade on behalf of getting LilyPond enabled on Wikimedia.  If you want that, you have to put in the work yourself.  That includes ensuring that the objections to LilyPond are addressed.  The objections were clearly stated from the first time an appropriate individual reviewed the software, more than a year ago, and if they weren't clear enough then you could have sought more clarity.  If you think this should have been brought up on the LilyPond mailing list, why didn't you do so yourself?

I don't personally care whether LilyPond or ABC is used.  I would never use either one either as a reader or an author.  I had never heard of either before I started looking into this bug report, and I have to this date never used either.  I literally cannot even read musical notation.  I am only putting any effort into this at all (as a volunteer MediaWiki developer who has no decision-making power on this but is familiar with how extensions get enabled) because it's clear a substantial number of users are interested.  I am continuing to put effort into it, out of charity, despite your abusive language, because I still do care about the large number of users who are interested.

A number of people have said that ABC would at least be a start, even if it would be somewhat inferior, and it looks like it could get enabled rapidly.  I don't care who you want to blame for it, but an acceptable LilyPond extension does not exist right now, while an acceptable ABC extension does.  For that reason, and that reason alone, I've suggested that it be enabled right now instead of waiting around indefinitely for a LilyPond extension.  A LilyPond extension (if one is made that's acceptable to use) could be enabled in addition to an ABC extension if the community desired this at some later date.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >What we're looking for here is much different from a typical &quot;safe mode&quot;; the proposed &quot;no scheme mode&quot; may be more appropriate, if that gets implemented.

This doesn't need to be an ABC vs. LilyPond thing.  Using one now doesn't mean we can't use the other later, or even that they can't coexist.  At this point, it's more a matter of what can be ready the soonest, since a few projects are waiting for this functionality, and it looks like ABC is the furthest along.  

Yes, if there's a simple way to enhance LilyPond to make it useful for this, someone who is involved with LilyPond should ask for it.  Then, someone should get the extension to use it, and advocate to have that enabled so that projects can use it.

But if ABC is ready now, we should use it now.  That will give the communities functionlity they've been waiting for, and should have little or no effect on whether LilyPond is used when ready.

It's perfectly fair and understandable if you didn't want to put more work into it because you felt dispirited by the lack of response.

So please make it clear to a normal user with no knowledge about either lilipond nor wikimedia software what is going wrong then I'll try to be the parrot who talks to lillypond people. 

In german there is a game called &quot;stille Post&quot;  A group of n people are sitting around a table. Person 1 tells person 2 something in a way that nobody else can hear it and writes it to a paper  that no one can read at that moment. person 2 tells person 3 the secret and so on the last person in the row tells loud what message he receives this will be compared to the written message. There is allways a big laughing in the end.

If you thing this is a usefull way to talk about security issues in such a big software system, lets give it a try.

On the other hand if you, who knows these issues exactly, can easily give a clear an simple definition of the problem(s) communicate with the lillypond people and we will get a good fix in the end for lillipond.

I don't think someone will burden the work to you but everybody would be happy if the problems can be fixed in a professional manner
by a correct definition of the problem. If there is assistance needed, that has nothing to do with this technical aspects simply ask

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >There is a place when is allowed to use lilypond code to make sheet music, I don't remember its name...it is like &quot;wiki...&quot; and it says it's a sandboard. If we can use it in that wikipage, why cannot be used in wikipedia or wikiversity? I think that while we keep discussing if we should include lilypond or not, there are a lot of projects that can't be done by that reason. I could mention a manual to learn to read music...if we had a lilypond module everyone could improve that manual and make that project succeed. Someone once told me &quot;Hey, but you can send a picture of the score and the people can see it&quot;...but imagine for a moment that this thing happens but not with notes, but with TEXT: &quot;Hey man, you can upload a picture of your essay about general relativity and the people could read it&quot; and another guy (maybe a PHd), in the opposite side of the world, wants to edit the document because he thinks it should be more accurate...¿How could he do it?¿Maybe writing down all the essay and send a picture again with the text corrected, and so on? ¿Isn't it more difficult to improve the information in wikipedia that kind of &quot;send and receive this pictures&quot;?

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >All I can do is to agree to Johann. Musicians do really need a tool for writing music like mathematicians do need their TeX for writing formulae. And math people have their tool since wikipedia started; musicians are waiting patiently since 2004 when this thread started. And there is no visible sign that this state will change.

It would be better to get a working tool with deficiencies fast than to wait another five years of sleeping discussion until perhaps a perfect solution will be worked out. And a suboptimal solution can be improved during the time it can be used.

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Okay, to be _really_ frank, this whole talking in the wrong place (security issues should be raised with the maintainers!  That should be _obvious_!) and the whole politicking and assuming-without-asking around this issue are really appalling.

If there is somebody sane to work with, I am more than willing to address all issues.  I will not work with people I lost respect for, though.

So, if you're interested, these are the steps to be taken:

1) Pester the people who are responsible for not including LilyPond support for the _real_ reasons.

2) Sort out any handwaving arguments until you have clean and clear questions or issues.

3) Send technical issues off to the LilyPond devel list (I'll be waiting there).

4) Work with me to resolve the issues.

5) Go back to 1) (as I said, I lost respect for quite some of those people, so I am the wrong guy to do it).</pre>

I don't agree with you, brf.
I think Dscho said what is most rational _to do_: Since #49 there was no comments from the Wikimedia developers about this bug and they had not discussed the issues with the LilyPond developers. (I was looking for this at <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/lilypond-devel/2009-04/msg00273.html">http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/lilypond-devel/2009-04/msg00273.html</a> [Sorry for the delay in the answer Dscho, I was a little busy this two weeks =/])

But, it is needed to have a clear description of the problem in order to have a solution. In other words, even if someone could work on LilyPond to correct the problems, they would need to know what the problems are! In this sense, we need the participation of Wikimedia team...

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >There has been no politicking here with regards to ABC vs. LilyPond.  Tim Starling is the most likely to enable either, and he's said (<a href="show_bug.cgi?id=189#c40">comment #40</a>) that he believes LilyPond to be musically much superior.  But by the admission of its own documentation, LilyPond might use an arbitrarily large amount of resources if maliciously fed pathological input.  That is the reason it is off the table, period.  It's a DoS vector.  If anyone (Wikipedia users, LilyPond developers, whatever) want to try getting that fixed, they're welcome to.  Claiming that people have ulterior motives for going with ABC is not only offensive, but patently absurd.  The concerns have been stated very clearly.

Music support is not a top-priority feature and might not receive as much initiative from Wikimedia people as music lovers would like, but that's life.  There are thousands of open bugs and most don't end up with much developer attention.  It is not the duty of MediaWiki developers to try getting any *specific* bug or feature request fixed, even the paid ones.  If *you* want to see a particular bug fixed, *you* have to try to persuade one or more suitable developers to give it more attention.

Although I can't even read sheet music, I've been periodically pestering Tim about enabling ABC, since some users seem to want it a lot (even if it's markedly inferior to LilyPond, which everyone seems to agree on).  He says maybe he'll enable it after the 1.15 release and the next scap.  Even if ABC is enabled, LilyPond could still be considered at some later date if it's demonstrated to not be a security concern.  In that case, ABC could be phased out from Wikimedia content in favor of LilyPond, and ABC eventually disabled.

How is Aryeh being unwilling here? He's pointed out what the DoS vector is (unlimited resource usage for evil input), and said to ask if anything needed clarification. The seriousness of the possibility of unlimited resource usage and the ease with which an attacker could craft input triggering that (by trying on their local LilyPond install first) seems to be pretty much proven to me.

If you believe the DoS issue is no longer an issue (you seem to be suggesting this), please tell us (mentioning what was done to fix it, of course).</pre>

I'm really sorry about my previous comment... I misunderstood the situation
when I wrote &quot;there was no comments from the Wikimedia developers about this
bug&quot;:
* I forgot your <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=189#c62">Comment  #62</a> =(
* I was thinking about Tim/Brion, because by comments like <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=189#c25">Comment  #25</a> it
seemed to me that it would be necessary a explanation of some of them about the
&quot;real reasons&quot; that Dscho pointed in (1)
Sorry again... 

Well, as I saw at <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=189#c55">Comment  #55</a> and at
<a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/lilypond-devel/2009-02/msg00022.html">http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/lilypond-devel/2009-02/msg00022.html</a>
the item (b) pointed by Tim (in <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=189#c37">comment  #37</a>) is not really a issue, am I
right?

But in the same message Graham Percival said that &quot;trying to keep lilypond
within certain CPU-time limits is going to be hard&quot;. Would this be solved by
doing what Dscho said at
<a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/lilypond-devel/2009-02/msg00023.html">http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/lilypond-devel/2009-02/msg00023.html</a>
?

After this, was said that &quot;Scheme just should be disabled for the purpose of
the MediaWiki extension.&quot;
(<a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/lilypond-devel/2009-04/msg00265.html">http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/lilypond-devel/2009-04/msg00265.html</a>). How
much of the issues would be solved with this?

By the way, I've found this other discussion, now about a new extension ABC
<a href="http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-l/2008-October/039988.html">http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-l/2008-October/039988.html</a>

I would like to know if the 3 questions Brion asked about it are also to be
considered in the context of LilyPond extension?

A nice week to all! =D

I should think not.  Even if most music won't work, it's a wiki, people can adapt it or rewrite it.

<span class="quote">&gt; But in the same message Graham Percival said that &quot;trying to keep lilypond
&gt; within certain CPU-time limits is going to be hard&quot;. Would this be solved by
&gt; doing what Dscho said at
&gt; <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/lilypond-devel/2009-02/msg00023.html">http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/lilypond-devel/2009-02/msg00023.html</a>
&gt; ?</span >

You mean:

<span class="quote">&gt; But we could add a simple timeout that says &quot;if this fails to 
&gt; terminate in 20 seconds, it errors _out_&quot;.</span >

I assume that would address all DoS concerns, if memory and disk use are also limited (either explicitly, or as a practical matter).  I'd assume that any reasonable score could be created in well under 20 seconds.  It wouldn't be ideal, though.  It would lead to intermittent failure for input that's close to the limit, and it might cause occasional failures if the server is under high load briefly for some reason.

For wikitext, which can also be very slow, we have limits like &quot;no more than X of this instruction&quot; instead, calibrated so as to make DoS unlikely.  Likewise, for ImageMagick I believe we have pixel limits on what images it will try to resize.  This way the software behaves consistently regardless of server load or other hard-to-control factors, but it's harder to do, of course.

<span class="quote">&gt; After this, was said that &quot;Scheme just should be disabled for the purpose of
&gt; the MediaWiki extension.&quot;
&gt; (<a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/lilypond-devel/2009-04/msg00265.html">http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/lilypond-devel/2009-04/msg00265.html</a>). How
&gt; much of the issues would be solved with this?</span >

I'd assume that disabling Scheme would be necessary, but not sufficient.

<span class="quote">&gt; By the way, I've found this other discussion, now about a new extension ABC
&gt; <a href="http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-l/2008-October/039988.html">http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-l/2008-October/039988.html</a>
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to know if the 3 questions Brion asked about it are also to be
&gt; considered in the context of LilyPond extension?</span >

I guess . . . those are infrastructural issues, not related to LilyPond itself but to how the images are stored and so on, issues that the MediaWiki extension would have to deal with.  Currently we have a fairly ugly system for math images, where they're stored on NFS and not ever expired.  I don't know if adapting a similar system would be acceptable or not.

I'll try getting Tim or Brion to reply to your questions so you can get a more definite answer.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Hi all. I want to post a comment i did in 2007...i feel pity because nothing has changed since that year.  Maybe i have to give up music and become a programmer or an engineer to fix this bug...
Note: I prefer lilypond, it is not only superior, but it can be used in many languages, primary goal for wiki projects.

Here is the 2007's comment:

Good morning. The basic thing is that a music edition feature in wikiarticles
(including wikipedia, wikiversity and &quot;wikiversidad&quot;) is needed. Many people
have asked for it but no answeres are receieved in help pages. I wish this
feature be enabled to start a course on music in wikiversdad, but it just don't
work in the way that i found in wikisophia.org. I encourage the use of lilypond
as a language to create scores, with all its funcionality. It is necessary to
listen to the music that is written via a &quot;button&quot; that allow the user to start
the playing of what is written; another essential thing is that this
&quot;listening&quot; capability can be opened in a new window in order to allow the
pupil to listen to the music and to read the music simultaneously.
In other hand, i wish it could be in the way that all wikis works; for example,
we don't need to install anything additional to begin to write an article, we
just click on the &quot;edit&quot; button and everything works fine...we want music to be
edited that simply way. Remember we're not programmers, we're just musicians,
and we want to worry about the music, not to begin a course on programming
languages or algorithms to create a music course.
Please, excuse me for my english; maybe this appeared a little &quot;tough&quot;, but i'm
not good speaking english. I just want to tell that i tried to be as kind as
possible with my short knowledge of this language. Thank you very much.

We're aware that LilyPond is superior and that people really want music module. We're also aware that this has taken a very long time, and that that sucks. I don't mean to be rude, but yet another post pointing out how useful a music module would be is not very useful or productive.

Extensions that got enabled on these small wikis and not on big ones are usually extensions which are (expected to be) slow on large wikis due to their size. The DoS issue that exists (existed?) with the LilyPond extension is in a different ballpark, though: if attackers can make the servers grind to a halt by providing LilyPond with input specially crafted to take a huge amount of time/memory/both to process, it doesn't matter which wiki that input comes from; the size of the wiki is irrelevant here.</pre>

Yes, it's quite easy to do. If the lot of you got together and wrote code instead of arguing about it on a bug report, it'd be done by now. Then I'd have code to review.

My interpretation of Tim's comment is that this extension is not accepted yet because the issues mentioned in <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/lilypond-devel/2009-02/msg00019.html">http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/lilypond-devel/2009-02/msg00019.html</a> haven't been addressed properly: the unbounded resource usage issue was acknowledged, but since that mailing list thread there hasn't been a clear &quot;yes, this is still an issue&quot; or &quot;no, it's been fixed by now&quot;. As long as you (or another LilyPond developer) won't provide an clear and unambiguous yes or no as described above on each of the issues mentioned in that mailing list post, we really don't know what's going on and we can't really do anything.

If there is still no (attempt at a) fix for the issues mentioned earlier (again, I don't know whether they have because no one's telling), then you guys have obviously not written any (relevant) code since your last patch (dating back to 2005) and have been arguing here.

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >I think there is  one big misunderstanding here. 

Most of the people who are requesting a music module arn't developers, neither wikimedia nor lillipond. They are simple users who have a need for incorporating notes to articles either wikipedia odr wikisource and begging for years for a solution of that.  SO most of us have the problem that we have a wish an nobody is supporting us for years. 

Please could some of the skilled people who know how to incorporate or generate  a musik module help the commiunity.

As far as I can see you are using more time on arguing as an workin on that issue.

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Hi,

Tired of see that this doesn't seems to solve anything (afer 5 years), I wrote to Jimbo this mail with my thoughts.

I think the matter is if music have enough relevance to be included in wikimedia projects and dedicate resources (-&gt; developers time) to solve the needed issues to have a safe notation extension. Musicians think so, and wikimedia developers doesn't seem to do it. Let's see what is the Jimbo opinion...


Best regards,
Natanael.

Subject: 	Do you think that music have cultural importance?
Date: 	Sat, 09 May 2009 13:54:14 +0200

Hi Jimbo,

Sorry to bother you... But, if you think the answer to the subject 
question is yes, could you please take a look to this bug report: 
<a href="https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=189">https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=189</a> ?

Is a 5 years bug report, where we are asking for a musical notation 
plugin for wikipedia/wikisource/wikiversity projects, which is an 
essential need for teach/learn/document music. All the answers we got is 
to bother more the developers, because they doesn't think that bug 
report have a priority.

Thinking about wikimedia projects as cultural resources, I think it 
SHOULD have considered as a priority.


Again, sorry to bother you, but I'm tired to see discussions there that 
doesn't seems to solve anything.

Thanks in advance, and thank you also for your amazing projects and 
cultural resources for all the humanity :)
Natanael.</pre>

Either a LilyPond dev is willing to put in the work and submit it for eventual inspection when Tim finds the time, and is willing to then work on any totally new issues that might come up in the course of the review, without any advance guarantee that their work will ever get enabled on Wikipedia; or not.  If so, that's great.  If not, it looks like LilyPond support won't happen, and ABC will have to do.

It's unfortunate that we don't have the resources to get every single bug fixed as nicely as everyone would like, but no software project does.  There are thousands of open bugs here and a lot have unreviewed patches attached.  If, in fact, nobody from LilyPond is willing to work on this without guaranteed returns (entirely understandable), and nobody on Wikimedia's side is willing to give guarantees in advance (this seems certain), then I suggest that everyone drop the issue until the status quo changes, rather than dwelling on it.  Complaining is not going to give the relevant people more time that they can spend on things that are, to them, evidently low-priority.

Now could I please ask everyone -- MediaWiki developers, LilyPond developers, Wikipedia users, and everyone else -- to stop using Bugzilla as a discussion forum, and only post further if you have anything to say *that will contribute to fixing the bug* (e.g., an expression of interest in working on a LilyPond solution, or a note on progress in enabling ABC).  You're spamming a significant number of uninterested people with every uninformative post you make.  The correct fora for recriminations and complaints (on both sides) are wikitech-l and/or lilypond-devel, if anywhere.  If you really just have to respond to someone else's misplaced Bugzilla comment, you can do it by e-mailing them privately.  Thank you.</pre>

No, this is not enough.  At best, it limits the DoS potential to halting display of all new music, which is still unacceptable.  The problem is perfectly solvable, but it's not trivial, and it will require effort.  Nobody on Wikimedia's side looks interested at the moment, and nor does anyone from LilyPond given the lack of assurance that their code will end up being deployed.

As I said in <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=189#c92">comment 92</a>, please do not use Bugzilla as a discussion/advocacy forum.  It just spams people and doesn't help anything.  *Only* post a new comment if you're willing to help work on the problem, or have other *useful* information.  You can go to wikitech-l, which MediaWiki developers/Wikimedia sysadmins pretty much all read, if you want to discuss this:

<a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/wikitech-l">https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/wikitech-l</a>

You'll be more likely to get useful results there.</pre>

&gt; 
&gt; Most of the people who are requesting a music module arn't developers, neither

&gt; incorporating notes to articles either wikipedia odr wikisource and begging for
&gt; years for a solution of that.  SO most of us have the problem that we have a
&gt; wish an nobody is supporting us for years. 
&gt; 
&gt; Please could some of the skilled people who know how to incorporate or generate

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >I've looked at the source code for abcm2ps now, and I think that from a security perspective, it would be better to use Lilypond or abc2ly. I've found 3 distinct buffer overflow vulnerabilities in abcm2ps, just with a quick review. No doubt fuzz testing would find more. It's the worst kind of C code, full of static buffers, with length checking implemented inconsistently. It also has two arbitrary local file reads and an arbitrary postscript injection feature.

Lilypond is at least fairly well studied. If someone DoS's it we can always disable the extension.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Further to that: note that PostScript is a Turing complete language. ImageMagick invokes Ghostscript, which is a complete implementation of it. You can do fun things like generating fractals:

<a href="http://www.physics.uq.edu.au/people/foster/postscript.html">http://www.physics.uq.edu.au/people/foster/postscript.html</a>

So like Lilypond, abcm2ps+convert can have arbitrary running time, by way of the postscript injection feature. 

What I'd like to see from a Lilypond extension is:

* Coding style and security as per the relevant pages on mediawiki.org
* Generally good programming practice, like not pretending to be a math extension as in <span class="bz_obsolete"><a href="attachment.cgi?id=1141" name="attach_1141" title="new version of LilyPond extension">attachment 1141</a> <a href="attachment.cgi?id=1141&amp;action=edit" title="new version of LilyPond extension">[details]</a></span>
* Optionally, multiple input formats via the *2ly programs distributed with Lilypond
* Optionally, Ogg Vorbis output and OggHandler integration
* Optionally, remote rendering, say via Http::get() to a remote instance of MediaWiki. This would allow for a fixed resource pool, alleviating DoS concerns.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Is it helpfull to mark it as obsolete?

Is there any knowledege, wether this patch must be applied for the new version too?

It would be  much more helpfull, instead of downgrading, by removin inforamtion like this patch, to give assistance to get a music module up an running.

Is it necessary to add a {{Security alert}}[1] to the extension's page (such as that on [[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&go=Go&search=mw%3AExtension%3AAbcMusic">mw:Extension:AbcMusic</a>]]), warning the user about the security problems/vulnerabilities pointed out by Tim on <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=189#c103">comment 103</a> and <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=189#c105">comment 105</a>?

For me, the TMH player is eventually shown on preview, after a delay of about 10 seconds.

Yes, it seems to show up a long time after the load event fires, and long after the last HTTP request appears in firebug. I'm not sure what it could be doing with all that time. Whatever it is, it doesn't max out the CPU. Anyway, it's a subject for a separate bug report.</pre>
