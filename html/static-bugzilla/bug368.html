alt text (shown instead of the image by text browsers or audio browsers), title

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >However, the most appropriate alt text for an image is 
usually nothing at all -- even on a Wiki, despite Wikis' 
avoidance of purely decorative images. Usually a Wiki 
image is either a diagram of a point that has already 
been put, as well as it can be in text format, in the 
article text already (in which case repeating it as more 
text is pointless), or it's an illustration of something 
that's marginally interesting to those viewing images 
(e.g. a person's appearance) but not interesting enough 
to feature in a text-only rendition of an article (e.g. 
you wouldn't bother mentioning the image if reading the 
article to someone over the phone). I am not saying alt 
should always be nothing at all, but it is more likely 
that the most appropriate alternate text will be nothing 
than that the most appropriate caption will be nothing.
 
Therefore, I think alternate text should come after the 
caption, to reduce the compulsion for people to create 
redundant alt text (which they frequently do). I don't 
see the point of having a customizable title= at 
all, but I suppose that belongs to another bug report.</pre>

This is simply incorrect.  

This is saying that users of alternative browsers or on slow connections 
should be denied access to images.  It's also treating some 
handicapped users as second-class citizens.  If there's a a point in 
putting an image into an article, then everyone who reads the article 
should be able to see that it's there, get an idea of what it is, and have 
the option of loading or downloading it.

All images on WP must have alt attributes.  Many will have captions, but 
they aren't strictly necessary, as many images can speak for themselves 
(unless, of course, they have empty alt text).  E.g.: a prominent portrait 
on a bio page, a chart with a graphical title/caption, a country's 
location map.

And remember that every image on WP also serves as a link to the 
Image: page, which may contain a more information that's not in the 
article, important copyright info, or a more detailed text description of 
the image.

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Firstly, note that image parameters are not order-specific, so all discussion of
&quot;which should come first&quot; is irrelevant. The only parameter that is currently
order specific is that which is currently used for alt, title and caption; this
is order specific in the sense that it is not treated as a parameter at all.
(Roughly, the syntax is
[[&lt;image-name&gt;|&lt;zero-or-more-params&gt;|&lt;caption-and-alt-text&gt;]]). If we wanted, we
could define parameters of form alt=, caption= and title= and use the last
not-really-a-parameter only as a fall-back. This leaves us with two questions:
precedence, and defaults.

[I'll refer to the text currently used for all three as &lt;alltext&gt;]
* &lt;caption&gt; text is only used on images using the &quot;frame&quot; or &quot;thumb&quot; parameters;
it needs to default to &lt;alltext&gt; to avoid breaking current usage. 
* &lt;alt&gt; text should be present on every image, but ideally be different from a
visible caption; however, non-captioned images (those with neither &quot;thumb&quot; nor
&quot;frame&quot;) may have &lt;alltext&gt; deliberately chosen as a good &lt;alt&gt;; we could
therefore fall back to &lt;oldtext&gt; for non-captioned images, but generate
something from the filename for captioned images.
* title text is the other position of &lt;alltext&gt; in non-captioned images, and so
like &lt;alt&gt; should probably fall back to that; it's less clear, however, what
fallback title a captioned image should have

I propose the following:
[[Image:&lt;filename&gt;|&lt;options&gt;|alt=&lt;alt&gt;|title=&lt;title&gt;|&lt;caption&gt;]]
* &lt;caption&gt; is compulsory, as now; the others are optional
For a non-captioned image:
* the alt attribute contains &lt;alt&gt; if set, &lt;caption&gt; otherwise
* the title attribute contains &lt;title&gt; if set, &lt;caption&gt; otherwise
For a captioned image:
* the alt attribute contains &lt;alt&gt; if set, &lt;filename&gt; otherwise
* the title attribute contains &lt;title&gt; if set; if none set, I'm not sure: &lt;alt&gt;?
&lt;filename&gt;? &lt;caption&gt;?; note that if &lt;alt&gt;, we need a third fallback for when
that isn't set either.</pre>

If we still use the current &lt;alltext&gt; as a fall-back for anything, we need a way

However, no non-captioned image should have links in its &lt;alltext&gt; anyway, so if

Blank alt text does not deny the image to anyone. It simply prevents the image from sometimes becoming a great 
annoyance.

As Matthew pointed out, alt text is currently usually duplicated caption text - what's the point in that? The 
caption text is already in the document. Having it displayed or read out twice is pointless. 

<span class="quote">&gt; All images on WP must have alt attributes.</span >

Yes, but the attribute may be empty.

<span class="quote">&gt; Many will have captions, but they aren't strictly necessary, as many images
&gt; can speak for themselves (unless, of course, they have empty alt text).
&gt; E.g.: a prominent portrait on a bio page, a chart with a graphical
&gt; title/caption, a country's  location map.</span >

For a portrait, good alt text would either be nothing or possibly a brief description of the person's appearance 
(especially if their appearance is specifically relevant to the article). Bad alt text is &quot;George W. Bush&quot;, it adds 
nothing - but it's what a lot of portraits currently have.

For a chart, good old text would be details about the data it shows - possibly a brief summing up of the results 
with a link to full information.  Bad alt text is &quot;a chart showing the growth of Wikipedia&quot;.

For a map, good alt text could be a brief description on where the country is, presuming it isn't already in the 
text. Bad alt text is &quot;a map of &lt;wherever&gt;&quot;. Especially bad alt text is &quot;Image:LocationUSA.png&quot;, as you currently 
get.

Most of the bad alt text would make an appropriate title, however.

<span class="quote">&gt; And remember that every image on WP also serves as a link to the 
&gt; Image: page, which may contain a more information that's not in the

- what's the point in that? The

Hence my suggestion that it not default to being the same as &lt;caption&gt;, ever.
But images that don't use |frame| or |thumb| don't have automatic captions
anyway, so its a case of deciding whether the text that has been entered should
be used for alt, title, or both.

Just a small point: as far as I know, alt attributes can't contain links;
they're just a short string.

The problem is, how to tell which any given image's label is: a decent alt text,
or a decent title text. If we default to alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&lt;alltext&gt;&quot; we break any
images where people *did* consider the alt text. For captioned images, though,
you might be right: just fall back on &quot;&quot;.

<span class="quote">&gt; &gt; And remember that every image on WP also serves as a link to the

Auto-linking caption text to the image page runs contrary to the current ability
to put formatting - including links - in the caption. I'm afraid I don't know
anything about the longdesc attribute: what is its official role, and is it
widely supported by UAs?

I guess it all boils down to whether we think that people who can't see images
would want to know they were there anyway. The advantage of having a non-blank
alt text is that it shows the user that there is something there, and allows
them to easily access a description page which may have more details about it
(which could include the description of results for a graph...). The
disadvantage is that, since they can't see it, they may simply be frustrated at
an alt text that tells them little more than that there is an image there.</pre>

&gt; &gt; &gt; However, the most appropriate alt text for an image is 
&gt; &gt; &gt; usually nothing at all
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This is simply incorrect.  
&gt; 
&gt; No, it isn't. It's a very valid viewpoint (and I don't believe alt text is an exact science, there are many 
&gt; different points of view), and one that I share.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; This is saying that users of alternative browsers or on slow connections 
&gt; &gt; should be denied access to images.  It's also treating some 
&gt; &gt; handicapped users as second-class citizens.  If there's a a point in 
&gt; &gt; putting an image into an article, then everyone who reads the article 
&gt; &gt; should be able to see that it's there, get an idea of what it is, and have 
&gt; &gt; the option of loading or downloading it.
&gt; 
&gt; Blank alt text does not deny the image to anyone. It simply prevents the image from sometimes becoming a </span >
great 
<span class="quote">&gt; annoyance.</span >

Images with blank alt attributes, *and* the links surrounding them, are hidden and inaccessible in Lynx.  I 
presume that audible and braille page readers would similarly omit an empty string, and possibly the existance 
of the link, too.  There are probably other cases we haven't thought of.

<span class="quote">&gt; 
&gt; As Matthew pointed out, alt text is currently usually duplicated caption text - what's the point in that? The 
&gt; caption text is already in the document. Having it displayed or read out twice is pointless. </span >

I agree; this is the point of this bug.  A mechanism that lets us specify useful alt text, and optionally captions.  A 
caption is *not* a substitute for alt text.  

Captions are displayed next to an image, *adding to or claryifying* information that we can see by viewing the 
image.

Alt attributes (optionally supplemented by title attributes and longdesc destinations) attempt to be a *substitute 
for the image*.  The W3's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines say that these should constitute &quot;equivalent 
information to the visual or auditory content.&quot;
 
<span class="quote">&gt; &gt; All images on WP must have alt attributes.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, but the attribute may be empty.</span >

Yes, this is a way to *hide* a purely decorative image.  The HTML 4 recommendation section 13.8 says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Do not specify irrelevant alternate text when including images intended to _format_ a page, for instance, 
alt=&quot;red ball&quot; would be inappropriate for an image that adds a red ball for decorating a heading or paragraph. In 
such cases, the alternate text should be the empty string (&quot;&quot;).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I can't think of any instances on Wikipedia where an uploaded image is purely decorative. If the image is 
content, then alt text must also be content.  Alt attributes with zero content are for images of zero content.


<span class="quote">&gt; &gt; Many will have captions, but they aren't strictly necessary, as many images
&gt; &gt; can speak for themselves (unless, of course, they have empty alt text).
&gt; &gt; E.g.: a prominent portrait on a bio page, a chart with a graphical
&gt; &gt; title/caption, a country's  location map.
&gt; 
&gt; For a portrait, good alt text would either be nothing or possibly a brief description of the person's appearance 
&gt; (especially if their appearance is specifically relevant to the article). Bad alt text is &quot;George W. Bush&quot;, it adds 
&gt; nothing - but it's what a lot of portraits currently have.</span >

A portrait is not decorative -- it conveys information about what a person's appearance, dress, and age.  It can 
provide information about context and period (e.g. sepia-toned photo in a top-hat, or fresco with crown and 
sceptre).

A brief description would be good, but even &quot;portrait photo of George W. Bush&quot; tells you what's there, and helps 
you decide whether to look at it.  

If the alt text is empty, how does a user browsing without images know that there is a portrait available for 
viewing or downloading?  At best, some browser *might* show that some image exists or display its filename, 
which is practically never an acceptable text equivalent.  

<span class="quote">&gt; For a chart, good old text would be details about the data it shows - possibly a brief summing up of the </span >
results 
<span class="quote">&gt; with a link to full information.  Bad alt text is &quot;a chart showing the growth of Wikipedia&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; For a map, good alt text could be a brief description on where the country is, presuming it isn't already in the

<span class="quote">&gt; get.</span >

Agreed, but in all these cases bad alt text is better than no alt text.

<span class="quote">&gt; Most of the bad alt text would make an appropriate title, however.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; And remember that every image on WP also serves as a link to the 
&gt; &gt; Image: page, which may contain a more information that's not in the 
&gt; &gt; article, important copyright info, or a more detailed text description of 
&gt; &gt; the image.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd suggest that's what the longdesc attribute is for. But caption text can also be linked to the image page.</span >

longdesc is one way of indicating more info about an image.  Wikipedia makes it more accessible (in most 
current browsers) by linking the image to the full image page, which may carry additional text.

W3 HTML 4 recommendation section 13.2 says about alt and longdesc:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The alt attribute provides a short description of the image. This should be sufficient to allow users to decide 
whether they want to follow the link given by the longdesc attribute to the longer description...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ideally, the Image: page would include a fuller &quot;text equivalent&quot; of the image.  E.g. a description of George 
Bush's appearance and circumstances of the photo.  

As Wikipedia style guides are developed, we should incorporate more accessibility guidelines into them.  The 
Wikimedia interface must also be developed with the tools to support them.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >I think everyone can agree that the alt text for an image is logically
separate from the caption, as Matthew and others noted. As a practical
matter, a caption may contain links and be as long as reasonably
necessary, while alt text should be text-only and is generally shorter,
as Rowan said.

So we should be able to do:
[[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&go=Go&search=Image%3Afoo.jpg">Image:foo.jpg</a>|alt=&lt;alt&gt;|&lt;caption&gt;]]. I agree with that part of
Rowan's proposal, and hope most others do too.

The obvious question is what to do if no alt text is specified:
1) Use empty alt text
2) Use the caption

Option 2 would be most consistent with current behavior, and
is what Rowan proposed. However, I would favor option 1, for
the reasons Matthew and Tom gave. A caption is a long description
and could contain links, and in general doesn't make good alt
text, IMHO. If an image needs alt text, and it isn't specified,
I think that's a deficiency in the article, and not something
for which we can find a technical solution.

As Rowan noted, there is also the issue of the title attribute
of the link. Unlike the alt text, I don't see any good reason
to allow editors to specify the title explicitly; I think we
should keep the image syntax as simple as reasonably possible.
Practically speaking, the main use of the title attribute is in
a &quot;tooltip&quot; in modern browsers. Possibilities for title include:

1) Blank
2) The caption
3) The name of the link target (always the image page, for now)
4) Whatever the alt text is

I would argue against option 2 for the same reason as above.
I like option 3, which would give users with modern browsers
a hint about what happens when they click on the image, and
could complement a fix to <a class="bz_bug_link 
          bz_status_RESOLVED  bz_closed"
   title="RESOLVED FIXED - Allow images that link somewhere other than the image page (using normal link syntax)"
   href="show_bug.cgi?id=539">bug 539</a>. I don't feel strongly about
it, though.

(In reply to <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=368#c8">comment #8</a>)
<span class="quote">&gt; * title text is the other position of &lt;alltext&gt; in non-captioned images, and so
&gt; like &lt;alt&gt; should probably fall back to that; it's less clear, however, what
&gt; fallback title a captioned image should have</span >

When neither &quot;thumb&quot; nor &quot;frame&quot; is specified, the &quot;caption&quot; text isn't
used as a caption at all, so it makes sense to use it for the title.
I don't think it's necessary to use the caption for the title with
&quot;thumb&quot; or &quot;frame&quot;, though, because then the caption is always displayed.
I don't think it makes sense to repeat the caption, which the reader can
presumably already see, in the tooltip.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >The HTML spec's guidelines are not exhaustive. They say 
alt=&quot;&quot; is appropriate for &quot;purely decorative&quot; images, but 
that does not mean alt=&quot;&quot; is inappropriate in less &quot;pure&quot; 
cases. Even very smart people often misunderstand this.

Maybe this will help: Imagine that MediaWiki didn't allow 
graphics at all, just text. Would it be acceptable to 
litter articles with non-sequiturs like &quot;foopy.jpg&quot; or 
&quot;Eiffel Tower viewed from the east&quot;? Of course not. That 
wouldn't make any sense when listening to the article. 
Contributors would instead work towards the best possible 
text for the article.

Now imagine graphics support has been added to MediaWiki. 
For those using text-only UAs, has the best possible text 
for each article suddenly changed? No, the ideal text is 
still the ideal text. So there still isn't any reason to 
add gibberish like &quot;foopy.jpg&quot; or &quot;Eiffel Tower viewed from 
the east&quot; to the text. That still wouldn't make any sense 
when listening to the article. Anyone who listens to it can 
tell that any alt= text like that is wrong.

So when to use alt=? Well, occasionally a graphic makes 
some of that ideal text redundant. For example, a map may 
replace a sentence or two telling where a place is. A graph 
may replace a text summary of some data. A diagram may 
replace a list of instructions, a description of a chess 
move, etc. In these cases, the text that the image replaces 
should be moved into the alt= attribute for the image.

That is the only reason for alt= to be anything other than 
&quot;&quot;. It's the only reason. alt= is the *text equivalent*: 
the text that you honestly would have included if the image 
was never there, but that is redundant when the image is 
visible. alt= is hard to understand because often we have 
to work backwards. The image is introduced before the
text-only version is finished (especially on a Wiki, where 
the text is never finished), so we have to ask: &quot;If we had 
the ideal text, would this image replace any of it?&quot;

Portraits are an interesting example. Graphic portraits 
feature regularly in biographical articles, but textual 
portraits hardly ever do. So even if you *could* describe 
someone's appearance textually, the most appropriate alt= 
for a portrait image is still &quot;&quot; -- unless you can argue 
with a straight face that their appearance would still have 
been important enough to describe in the text if MediaWiki 
didn't allow images (which probably isn't true), *and* that 
the most appropriate text description is neatly made 
redundant by the image (which probably isn't true either).

... Apologies for turning Bugzilla into a podium.

For those concerned about breaking existing syntax for  
alternate text: I just visited [[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&go=Go&search=Special%3ARandompage">Special:Randompage</a>]] until 
I had encountered 50 images with custom alternate text 
specified. The alternate text was appropriate in ... zero 
of them. (That's even fewer than I was expecting.) So if 
the syntax is changed now, it will break very little that's 
not already broken, and certainly much less than it fixes.

You're using a backwards argument to say that images have no inherent
value.  An image that shows *what someone looks like* isn't replacing
some text in an article, *it is part of the article*.  It could still
have value to someone who is browsing without images turned on.  A
&quot;text equivalent&quot; (which can consist of one or more of alt, title, and
longdesc) attempts to:

  1. Indicate the presence and nature of the image.
  2. Convey some information which is in that image.

In an ideal world, the image's longdesc attribute links to a page that
actually describes the image in detail, so an unsighted user could get
an idea of what George Bush looks like.  Wikipedia's not there yet, so
we should be trying to improve accessibility, not work around it!

W3's Web Content Accessibility Guideline number 1 is &quot;Provide
equivalent alternatives to auditory and visual content&quot;.  Alt=&quot;Portrait
of George W. Bush&quot; is infinitely closer to this than alt=&quot;&quot;.

Okay, so if a Lynx user suspects that maybe you've hidden a link and a
portrait on a page, he can type &quot;*&quot;, guess that &quot;bush_por.jpg&quot; might be
useful, download the file, and fire up the Gimp to view the image.
Oops, turns out it's a Portuguese flowering shrub.

This doesn't prove that all non-visual browser users have access to
an image with alt=&quot;&quot;.

This doesn't fulfil WCAG Guideline 1.

This scheme substitutes dumb luck for established accessibility
techniques.  It's a somewhat poorer user experience than FTP.

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Fixed in <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:Code/MediaWiki/41364" title="revision 41364 in SVN">r41364</a>:

* [[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&go=Go&search=Image%3AFoo.png">Image:Foo.png</a>|alt=xyz]] now works as desired, setting the alt text.
* If no alt text is specified, the alt text is the empty string, since it's useless to repeat the caption.

If the second point causes problems for users of deficient user agents that are incapable of allowing their users to interact with images without alt text, please open another bug (and link to it from this one).  longdesc support would be nice, too, probably would be done by linking to a specially-named page like [[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&go=Go&search=Image%3AImagename%2Flongdesc">Image:Imagename/longdesc</a>]] if it exists and doing nothing otherwise (but that scheme would have to handle non-local images).  Again, that's another bug.

It's kind of sad that this was like a ten-line fix that anyone could have done at any point in the last four years, which could significantly increase Wikipedia's accessibility.  Oh well, it's done now.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >This caused parser test regressions; reverted in <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:Code/MediaWiki/41407" title="revision 41407 in SVN">r41407</a>:

Revert <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:Code/MediaWiki/41364" title="revision 41364 in SVN">r41364</a> -- broke 22 parser test cases with change of alt behavior.

The caption was originally defined *as* the alt text (defaulting to the image file name if there is no alt text). Note that a separate caption text is only displayed in some display modes ('frame' and 'thumb', iirc), and not by default.

Please run the parser tests and check the effect you have on them. If it's really an appropriate change, then update the test cases. If you're not sure, consider backing out pending further discussion.  :)

It might be appropriate to not set the 'alt' attribute for frame/thumb cases, but definitely not for inline images where we already have a way of setting the alt text which you're removing! </pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >I tried running the parser tests, but they weren't working for me, per the e-mail I sent to Wikitech-l: they crashed, <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:Code/MediaWiki/40209" title="revision 40209 in SVN">r40209</a> broke them.  So I couldn't make sure they passed.  And they're still broken on current trunk, with the same error message.  So I pointed out the problem and committed without the parser tests.

The behavior of using the same syntax to mean captions for thumbs/frames but alt text for inline images seems confusing and kind of broken, not at all what would be expected.  It seems like it would make more sense to consistently require alt= for alt text, for all images.  I'm guessing it wouldn't cause much incompatibility, because I don't think I've *ever* seen the extra parameter used for alt text on inline images.  Probably in most of the cases where it's used, people were trying to make a caption anyway, so the text would be just as inappropriate as in all the other cases.</pre>

I have seen images with the extra parameter with text. Perhaps not made for alt, 
but appropiate to be used as it. So it may be good to use alt parameter for 'normal'
images, but it should fallback to the text.
