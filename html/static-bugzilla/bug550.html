A already registerd user should always be abel to edit whatever his ipadress. Only the blocking of the 
username should block a registerd user. 

Creating new accounts from a blocked ipadress; this should be possible. But to prevent that vandals will keep 
creating accounts to abuse wikipedia more finetuning is needed. 

A option to switch the &quot;allow account creation&quot; on or off when you block a ipadres should be usefull to stop 
this type of abuse that now can not be because when you block a ipadress also registerd users are blocked.

I should block whit account creation on by default. But when there is abuse that you can put it off.

More abuse preventing can also be used;
I think of account activation by use of a email that you need to confirm.
Or a limitation of the number of edits that you can do.
-- If account is not at least x days old and there are more then x edits in 1 minute or x edits in the last 5 
minutes deny write access for x minutes

Strongly disagree. That would mean a vandal cannot be stopped by blocking at all
- if the user name is blocked he will create a new one (even if his IP is
autoblocked), if his IP is blocked he will create a new user account and
continue, and he will look like a normal newbie.</pre>

A vandal vandalizes and will be detected, and then his username will be blocked.
 If he creates an account and doesn't vandalize, then there is no vandlism
problem to justify blocking him.

If we don't follow this route then it will continue to be possible to block a
vandal on a shared proxy without barring other users from the same proxy.  In
practice these shared proxies are identified and administrators are reluctant to
block vandals at all because of the risk of collateral damage.

Be aware, too, that even if this feature is implemented, it will be of no use
unless there is also a change of policy that permits the feature to be used.  It
seems to me that the ability to edit anonymously is held very dear by a number
of influential Wikipedians, and any suggestion that it be tampered with will
meet substantial resistance.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >This is following David Gerard's comments on the Arbitration request about
user:Zivinbudas on the English Wikipedia (en:WP:RFA)

It should be possible to block anonymous editors from any given IP range, but
still allow registered users to edit (unless otherwise blocked). The block
wouldn't be permanent thing, just long enough for the intended user to get the
message. Those trying to edit anonymously from that range would see a notice
along the lines of:

    Due to the actions of one or more people who use the same ISP as you, it has
been necessary to temporarily disalow anonymous contributors from this IP range.
If you are not (one of) the user(s) in question, then you are welcome to
contribute as a registered user. &lt;standard create an account or log in stuff, or
link to it&gt;. 

Reading earlier comments about account creation, I don't think this should be
restricted but perhaps there should be a list somewhere of all accounts created
from an IP address in a range blocked as above. That way it will be easy to
check the contributions of those new accounts and to block any that are used for
vandalism or other block evasion.</pre>

It should be possible to identify an IP address which is a Proxy used by many people, and allow 
account creation from that address.

Conversely if an IP address is (provably) used only by a known vandal, it should be possible to 
arrange that no new accounts can be created from that address.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >I think there could be 2 types of IP blocks...

1. Low-level: No editng, allow reading, allow account creation, already
registered users may login (for regular vandals, or school proxies, etc.)
2. Medium-Level: No editing, allow reading, no account creation, already
registered users may login (perhaps something like this could be permanently
enforced on AOL proxies, and other open proxies).
3. High-Level: No editing, allow reading, no account creation, already
registered users may NOT login (for static IP addresses with problems or open
proxies at which there have been known to be numerous vandals with sockpuppets
[in the latter scenario, perhaps only for about 12 hours]).

It would be easy to implement all of these things in PHP and C++ (I don't know
how but it'd be easy to open the function up and when they try to access, say
editing, it would check the see their IP address, etc.)</pre>

This would be a Very Bad Thing to apply permanently, as it would prohibit any
editor from an AOL address who hasn't already created an account from doing so.
There are good users from that IP range as well as trolls and vandals. As a
short term measure (e.g. no more than 24 hours at a time) then it might be useful.

I don't see the need for this level - you would use level 2 on the IP address
and block any registered users you didn't want editing, while allowing good
users to edit normally.

Level 1 might be acceptable to leave in force for long periods of time when
needed, but level 2 should never be very long. Imho not blocking a bad user is
better than blocking good users.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >I never really understood why we would ever want to stop editors creating
accounts.  If the IP blocks were to only apply to non-logged-in accounts, then a
legitimate editor should have the opportunity to edit if he's prepared to create
an account.  Allowing logged-in edits and then stopping editors creating
accounts for editing at the very moment they need it doesn't seem right.

An IP-blocked editor could create &quot;an endless stream of accounts&quot;, but I don't
think this is a problem.  If he misbehaves again the account he uses gets
blocked.  The usual autoblock blocks the IP number he uses so his vandalism is
halted (alas in this case an autoblock also blocked other logged-in editors
using the IP number).  If the username block and any associated autoblocks are
then lifted manually in the usual way, other logged-in editors can edit.

So this isn't a magic bullet, it doesn't solve all vandalism and it doesn't
totally eliminate collateral damage, it isn't any *worse* than the situation at
present. It does permit us to deal with a widespread class of vandalism, by
non-logged-in editors, in a manner that causes less disruption to other editors
than at present.  And there is no instance in which an editor who would not find
himself wrongly blocked in the current scheme, would find himself blocked in the
same situation were my code to be incorporated, for instance, into English
Wikipedia.

I was wrong to say that an autoblock blocks logged-in users (I thought that it

The code change I am testing only blocks in the following circumstances:

1. A non-logged-in user tries to edit an IP number that has been explicitly blocked.
2. A logged-in user tries to edit when he has been explicitly blocked by username.
3. A non-logged-in user tries to edit on an IP that has been used by a blocked
logged-in user after he was blocked (autoblock).

In all cases the user can circumvent the block by creating a new account or
using an account that he has created previously.

To deal with possible responses to this by blocked users, it would be a good
idea to have tools to monitor account creations, and to monitor recent edits on
IPs previously used by blocked users. </pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Be careful. In the case of open proxies, if we block an open proxy IP, but still 
allow named user accounts to be created, then a vandal can easily bypass the 
block by creating a new user account. If we block that account, they can just 
create a new one, and continue to do so until every possible combination and 
permutation of usernames has been used up (which would also prevent legitimate 
users from having those account names). This process can also easily be 
scripted, and we'd have no way to stop then. Point is, blocking only anonymous 
edits from a blocked IP, will do nothing to stop vandals; we might as well 
discontinue account blocking altogether.

In fact, I really don't think it's worth blocking registered accounts AT ALL. 
Any determined vandal can easily get a new account. In a way, it would be better 
to DELETE the named account, since a subsequent user may want to legitimately 
use that account name. Why should we allow vandals to use up all the common 
account names?

I realize there are cases where legitimate users share a proxy (open or 
otherwise) with vandalous users. Other sites who use IP-based blocking suggest 
to users in this situation that they either:

a) Phone their ISP and demand a unique IP
b) Change ISP to one which allocates unique IPs

Hopefully as IPv6 becomes more commonplace, these shared proxies will have no 
reason to exist.

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >In case anyone is looking at this still, we had an issue with Ozemail users
accessing a proxy. Many schools shared this and they were vandalising a
ridiculous amount of articles (see [[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&go=Go&search=User%3ATa%20bu%20shi%20da%20yu%2FOzemail">User:Ta bu shi da yu/Ozemail</a>]]). I tried to
block these IP addresses permanently, but it blocked [[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&go=Go&search=User%3AMinorEdit">User:MinorEdit</a>]], who is
a good contributor. I tried to unblock him, but I noticed that this is not
possible. 

I'd like to add my vote of support : if only to have the ability to unblock an
editor if they ask us to. Doesn't have to be by default. If the editor is
unhappy about the block enough to complain then I'd LOVE to unblock them - just
not the IP address.

I'm sure [[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&go=Go&search=User%3AMinorEdit">User:MinorEdit</a>]] agrees: this has happened to him quite a few times

server, I'm keen to see this fixed. 

Could the solution be that when an anon IP is blocked - the possibility of
creating an account from it is suspended for a short perion (30 min or so)
irrespective of the length of the block. That would prevent vandals from
immediately creating accounts and continuing - but would not have a huge impact
on others.   </pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >I agree with Doc glasgow here, and would like to stress the positive effects of being 
able to do blocks like this.  Many a situation happens where proxies with legitimate 
uses are being used for wide-scale vandalism, but cannot be blocked for a long period 
of time because of the collateral damage.

In addition to the ideas above, what if all new users made by a &quot;half-blocked&quot; proxy 
were marked as such by the new user log?  This would make it a lot easier to track 
users who try to create new users from proxies to vandalize.</pre>

There is a technical possibility to separate the IP's from the

the vandals will register, before or after their blocking, because 
they are not stupid either. Now the recent changes have only to be

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Firstly, apologies for the tone of the following: I have just had to unblock myself for the fourth time 
in several months, after receiving a flood of emails from other users who - because this has 
happened in the past - know I have the same IP address. The current system DOESN'T WORK if there 
are admins who want to get online, because as soon as they want to start working on ongoing 
projects, the block has to be removed (There's NO WAY I' going to wait around three months for a 
block to end before starting to work on a project that I've been working on constantly for a week!) 
This new form of blocking wouldn't be 100% vandal-proof - nothing is - because vandals can create 
accounts. But ANY barrier in the way of a vandal will reduce some vandalism, and the blocking of new 
user names is a far less blunderbuss approach than blocking all users to an IP. If a delay was built in 
between a new account being created and a first edit (even just ten minutes), it would almost 
certainly reduce vandalism still further. Doc Glasgow's suggestion would work just as well as this, 
with a gap between the block and the allowing of user names to be created. The current system, 
though,  is completely screwed. I recently had an email from someone who was blocked by an IP - as 
was the ENTIRE SUBURB in which they were living (it seems that one IP was shared by the entire area).

In reply to some of the comments above: 
*Andreas Hörstemeier and Adrian Eyre - any slowing down in a vandal's ability to edit would reduce 
the amount of vandalism. Making sure that any vandal has to create a new user name will allow 
instant blocking of just the vandal and no-one else, and although they may make a new user name, it 
will be more of a chore to vandalise Wikipedia - especially since new user accounts from partially 
blocked IPs will be well watched. This in itself should reduce vandalism greatly. Adding in a time 
delay between creating a user account and first editing - as I have suggested above - would further 
reduce vandalism, since most &quot;casual vandalisers&quot; wouldn't bother waiting - they'd find othe fun 
things to mess around with. Blocking only the new accounts would allow other users to continue to 
edit - thereby not disadvantaging the many for the stupidity of the few.
* Martin Richards: Trying to build consensus? Of the first 50 votes indicated in the straw poll you 
have there, all but two are in favour of this measure in some form or other. If that isn't consensus, I 
don't know what is!
* Effeietsanders: Lose the opportunity to separate the andals from the users? Quite the opposite! With 
the current system there is nos eparation at all - all of them are blocked! With the suggested 
proposal, users will be allowed to edit and vandals will be under closer scrutiny (as they will have to 
create new user names once the block goes in place). All eyes will be on potential vandals, and they 
will be able to be pinpointed very precisely and quickly.
* Ryan Kaldari: A lot of us have already commented at [[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&go=Go&search=Wikipedia%3A%20Blocking%20policy%20proposal">Wikipedia: Blocking policy proposal</a>]], but this 
is now past the propsal stage and onto the request stage - any voices supporting that request should 
surely go here.</pre>

I'm trying to prepare a patch but things are going slow since I'm currently in
the last year of writing my PhD thesis and that leaves almost no time for other

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >I thought this was already implemented, but apparently, is not. 
Perhaps a more controversial approach is when an anonymous IP is 
blocked, but not registered users, there should be an ability to 
block edits from new accounts from that IP, accounts not meeting a 
certain existing edit threshold.

All of this should be used at the blocker's discretion, of course, 
and each of these options should only be invoked should things get 
worse. For example, anon IP blocked, but not registered users. 
Then the vandal goes ahead and creates a new account. After a 
while, account creation may be disabled and/or accounts not 
meeting a certain good edit threshold (which can be set from 5 to 
100) would not be able to submit edits as long as that block on 
the anon IP exists. After the block is lifted, then account 
creation or edits from those accounts would be lifted as well, of 
course. These are only some options. The other thing would be the 
ability to block certain users without blocking the IP if they 
used a shared IP, then invoking account creation suspension and 
threshold suspension if need be. 

Which reminds me, perhaps this could be brought up in a new 
bugzilla entry, but it is largely dependent on this passing: edits 
could be marked &quot;bad&quot; (ie. bad faith of pure vandalism, not 
something to be invoked in an edit war) in order to discount on a 
threshold. </pre>

Partial (incomplete) patch for this bug

I had started preparing a patch but I have to abandon it due to being
overloaded with other tasks. I'm true sorry for that but I just won't be able
to work on it in the forseeable future. I'm submitted the partial patch as it
is right now.

Here's a list of things that still need to be done:

User.php:
- isAllowedToCreateAccount() should return true if only weakly blocked
(mBlockIsWeak set)
- spreadBlock: spread block becomes hard or weak depending on setting in
DefaultSettings

EditPage:
- blockedIPpage() should check if only logged-in users are allowed to edit and
user is not logged in and modify message accordingly if this is the case. Cf.
$this-&gt;userNotLoggedInPage()
  
SpecialBlockip.php:
- add Option to Block logged-in users from this IP address: yes/no (probably no
by default).

SpecialBlockme.php:
- ditto

SpecialIpblocklist.php:
- allow converting weak to hard block and vice versa

Implement account creation hurdle (e.g. time delay / e-mail address required)
if wished (cf. discussion). Regarding e-mail validation, there are already some
fields such as user_email_authenticated etc. in the user table
(maintenance/tables.sql)

Divert the &quot;edit this page&quot; link for weakly blocked anons to a login page which
says something like: &quot;Because of problems with vandalism by some users from
your address space, you will need to register a username before editing.
Creating a Wikipedia username is free, and has many benefits... &amp;c. &amp;c.&quot;

I'm happy to answer questions regarding this but I'm afraid I won't be able to
give much help aside from that. Good luck to whoever wants to take on from
here!</pre>

Fine:

Same applies to schools/workplaces/senior citizen places where occasionally some vandals as well as 
serious editors share the same proxy. Then blocking the proxy temporarliy during a vandalism spree 
would not block the good contributor(s) from higher grades/a raise/whatever older people look for..

Open proxies are already blocked on site; and this includes some schools so it wouldn't be a new

I'm sure we'd make a policy saying that there'd be a max block time on such
policies. But instead of just blocking for 24 hours we'd block for max a week.
Those who are really serious can make an account, but the ips won't be
permanently blocked.

Incorrect. We are already blocking schools for 4 months or so after several of
their students have done vandalism, even though official policy is that you
cannot do so for more than one week. But alas, I have lost the fight anyway, so
who cares about my opinion?</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >My hope in supporting this enhancement was that it that it would _reduce_ the
number of hard IP blocks, by allowing to convert hard IP blocks for &quot;open
proxies&quot; such as schools, the Tor network etc. to weak blocks. This way, if the
account creation hurdle is not too high, serious contributions (of people
willing to that that hurdle and to login for edits) would again be possible from
these IPs, while spammers and most vandals would still be kept out.

Of course, it's possible that the feature would be user the other way round, by
adding lots of new weak IP blocks while preserving all hard block. I would think
that sad, but it would be up to the user community to decide.

Anyway, nobody seems to be working on this feature, and even if somebody
finished implementing it, it's completely unclear whether (a) it would be
incorporated into MediaWiki and (b) whether it would be turned on for the
English or any other Wikipedias. So if you think this a bad feature, you can
probably stop worrying about it...</pre>

Patch for this bug

I have now completed and tested the proposed patch, I´ve just attached the
completed version.

There is not (yet) an admin interface for setting the block level; instead,
block levels are controlled by configuration parameters. By default, all
explicit blocks of IP addresses are hard (controlled by
$wgWeakExplicitBlocks param). In the attached patch, blocks that spread from
an user to the IP she is using default to be weak ($wgWeakAutoblocks), and
so are blocks for IP addresses that are listed in open proxy
($wgWeakProxyBlocks) or SORBS ($wgWeakSorbsBlocks) blacklists. Of course,
these settings can easily be adjusted by changing the default values
specified in DefaultSettings.php.

For blacklists, it might make sense to add
information about whether a block is hard or weak to the list entries
themselves, or to use two different lists. This would allow to use weak
blocks for &quot;benevelent&quot; open proxies such as the TOR network
&lt;<a href="http://tor.eff.org/">http://tor.eff.org/</a>&gt;, and hard blocks for others.

Only autoconfirmed users are allowed to edit from an weakly blocked IP,
novices and anonymous edits are blocked. Account creation is possible, but
of course people will have to wait for their account to be autoconfirmed
until they can use it from a weakly blocked IP.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >This is the craziest &quot;bug&quot; I've ever read.  If a school cannot keep their
students from vandalizing, they should remain blocked.  If AOL won't cooperate,
they should be blocked and remain so for as long as they refuse to be decent
internet citizens.

Why does WMF want to allow vandalbot creation of user accounts from previously
blocked IP addresses?

The request here, should be to block *READ* access for blocked IPs.  That might
actually help, somewhat.  Making it more convoluted for casual users to register
is not better...the only ones that will figure it out are the vandals!</pre>

I hope that you will find yourself in a situation soon that you need to use an
internet connection with an external ipadress that shared with many users (and
is blocked) so you can not edit.

Yes, you can write to those schools to ask of the can stop the vandalism. But do
you realise how stupid that it looks when you contact them to ask them to stop
vandalism to a website where everybody can edit the texts? Not even the need to
login?

If I where from the school I would say to Wikipedia; So you are running a
website where everybody freely can edit the pages? And some of are users are
doing that and you do not like that? Sorry, not our problem. You are the ones
who are giving them write-access. We have other things to do. Like keeping the
computers working. 

On a daily basis I receive on OTRS (the Wikimedia email system) reports from
good editors who are not happy because the are blocked. And for something the
have not done. The only options I have is; 
- to not remove the block and so excluding good users
- to removed the block and pissing other sysops off and that user gets blocked
again after some vandalism from a user of that network.

This a very old problem. And I have the a very strong impression the problem is
not to solve it. But that lack of the will to solve it.</pre>

Connel MacKenzie, you're a genius. School teachers have so much free time that
they'll all help to track down the young vandals and put them on detention and
restrain them away from net access until the whole school is a perfect netizen.
The teachers will get onto IRC to discuss this with Wikipedia admins too.
Likewise, AOL is more than an ISP, it's a family where tech support enjoy
calling up their customers and reminding them in a fatherly way not to abuse the
community they live in so that all their brother and sister AOLers can enjoy the
Internet.

And in my home town of Melbourne, when I was blocked because I'm using a major
ISP (not affiliated with AOL) which happens to use a Squid proxy, as a caring
upstanding citizen I initiated a court order against my ISP so I could find out
where the offending user lived, rode my bike 15km to his house, knocked on his
door and kindly asked him to stop writing rude words on Wikipedia so that I
might get my access back, and so the people of Melbourne could once again be
seen with dignity and respect on Wikipedia. I did this again 2 days later when
it happened again.

It's a bug. It's a problem with Wikipedia. It's not a technical or social
solution. It's not a feature. If it were to be used as solution as you say, then
it would still need alternatives to be coded.

I've fed the troll enough today.

I hate to be overkill, but I third.

By the way, seeing as I've been coding a website for someone that uses a program in PHP that is 
pretty similarly coded to Mediawiki [big bag 'o' classes], I might be motivated enough to figure 
out how MediaWiki works and see if I can work out a good working patch for this. It is summer after 
all. But don't hold your breath.

That might be related to X-Forwarded-For
&lt;<a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/XFF_project">http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/XFF_project</a>&gt;, where the machine's true IP is
sent in the HTTP header by the proxy server. Only ISP's explicitly added to a
whitelist have their XFF headers accepted as valid by MediaWiki. I'm sure there
are other ways to find out the real IP too; that's just the only one I know of.

I wish this bug (with the full admin interface etc.) had been a project in
Google's Summer of Code. Hopefully this can get implemented soon. Big thanks to

This is why &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;weak&quot; blocks have been proposed above. A weak block
would ban just the registered user or just the ip (depending which was blocked);
a strong block would block the ip of the blocked user and registered users from
the same ip. Range blocks should work similarly.

There have also been proposals to allow creation of accounts to be suspended for
individual ip addresses/ranges independently of blocking. This would allow
existing registered users from an IP to continue to edit while preventing the
creation of sockpuppets.

Patch for this bug

Tim Starling didn't use the patch verbatim when performing 15482, so marking
this patch obsolete. The bug is fixed, however.</pre>
